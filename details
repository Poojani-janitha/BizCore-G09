Got it 👍 — since you want **each member to take full ownership of one ERP function (from UI design → backend coding → testing → deployment)**, the best way is to divide by **major ERP modules**. That way, every person builds a complete, end-to-end function that integrates into the overall ERP system.

### 🔑 Division of ERP Functions (4 Members)

| Member | ERP Function | Responsibilities (Beginning → End) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Member 1** | **Human Resources (HR)** | - Design employee management UI (profiles, attendance, payroll)<br>- Build backend for employee records & leave tracking<br>- Integrate payroll calculations<br>- Test HR workflows & deploy |
| **Member 2** | **Finance & Accounting** | - Create UI for invoices, expenses, and reports<br>- Implement backend for ledger, transactions, tax rules<br>- Build reporting dashboards<br>- Test financial accuracy & deploy |
| **Member 3** | **Inventory & Supply Chain** | - Design UI for stock management, purchase orders, suppliers<br>- Implement backend for inventory tracking & reorder logic<br>- Integrate with warehouse systems<br>- Test inventory workflows & deploy |
| **Member 4** | **Sales & Customer Management (CRM)** | - Build UI for customer database, sales orders, quotations<br>- Implement backend for order processing & customer interactions<br>- Integrate with email/notifications<br>- Test CRM workflows & deploy |

### 🛠️ Collaboration Rules
- **Shared Standards**: Agree on coding style, UI design guidelines, and database schema upfront.  
- **Integration Points**: Each module must expose APIs so they can talk to each other (e.g., HR payroll → Finance).  
- **Weekly Integration Testing**: After finishing a sprint, merge modules and test cross-functionality.  
- **Version Control**: Use GitHub/GitLab with feature branches per member.

### 🚀 Implementation Flow for Each Member
1. **UI Design** → Wireframes → Frontend coding (React/Angular/Vue).  
2. **Backend Development** → Database schema → API endpoints → Business logic.  
3. **Integration** → Connect with other modules via REST/GraphQL APIs.  
4. **Testing** → Unit tests + integration tests.  
5. **Deployment** → Push to staging → Validate → Go live.

✅ **Pro Tip**: Choose ERP modules that are **independent but interconnected**. This way, each member owns their function fully, but the system works seamlessly when combined.  

Would you like me to **map these four modules into a Gantt-style timeline** so you can see how each member’s work overlaps across phases (design, coding, testing, deployment)?
